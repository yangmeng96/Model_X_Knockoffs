# Model_X_Knockoffs
The report simulated gaussian data with p>n, then constructed Model-X knockoffs by ASDP, equicorrelated method and exact construction, and then compared FDP with the package “knockoff”. The result of my code and the package are almost the same, and the difference is caused by the choice of W.
